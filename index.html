          <h3>3 halos and a dynamic SVG ray - All syncing with each other</h3>

          <p>

            I needed to create the experience of a spotlight shining onto a dark area and illuminating text. Of course this is not simple with regular HTML. So I created some elements that work with each other to create this experience.
        
            Note that the central logo of the page (which contains the text that is to be illuminated) is masked by a black opaque layer (the darkness). I use a clip path that moves along with the spotlight 
            to reveal the text underneath and render a "hole" on the darkness layer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here are the elements that make up the spotlight experience:
          <ul>
            <li>Halo Component #1 (The External Halo): A div locked to the central logo container area of the page. This div has a radial gradient where the center of it is transparent and it becomes opaque as we go outwards. This was done simulate the diffusing light effect of a spotlight.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Halo Component #2 (A clip path ellipse): A clip path locked to the central logo container of the page. This is what enables a "peak" into the logo and creates a hole in the darkness layer.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Halo Component #3 (The ray's internal halo): A div with a radial gradient, where the center of the gradient is bright yellow with some transparent and which diffuses as we go outwards. This was to simulate the light that is shooting out of the emitter of the spotlight. It is meant to illuminate other parts of the page 
              such as when we hover our mouse over a menu button.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              SVG Ray: The ray of the spotlight is a SVG path composed of 5 points. 4 points that make up the corners of the ray, and 1 control point that dictates the concave curve at the top of the ray (which is responsible for "hugging" the halo).
              The top-left corner point, top-right corner point and the curve control point are programmed to track the edges of the halos as they move in each sweep.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            The green dashed lines you see are to represent the points that the SVG ray needs to keep track of during its sweep. As you can imagine,
            it was a challenge to keep them perfectly aligned together.

          <h2>Challenges of the project</h2>
          
          <p>This was an unexepectedly challening project. At first I thought it would be mostly a UI and purely visual designed based project. It instead turned out to be a study into 
            kinematics. Even moreso challenging were the lack of resources on this topic because of the unusual approach I took (more on this further down in the article). Which is why I had to figure out several concepts on my own and try out different approaches.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Precalculated CSS Animations And Alignment Issues</h3>
          <p>

            The thing that makes this page(interface) unique is that all the animations you see 
            on the page have randomized trajectories (starting and ending points), however 
            their motion is precalculated for each sweep! 
            
          </p>

          <p>
            To be more specific, the elements are NOT tracked and aligned in real time (which is traditionally what happens in a game environment or any interactive environment like this).
            what usually would be done is: The ray would first be aligned set a particular angle, and then the halo would get rendered based on where it is for each and every frame.
          </p>

          <p>
            But not here...over here, each element's motion path and acceleration pattern is built before the the sweep even begins. And each element is independent. They have to strive to always stay aligned with each other.
          </p>

          <p>
            The major challenges involved here were - How do I create an acceleration pattern for the ray, so that it will track the halos and maintain alignment with it throughout the entire trajectory. 
          </p>

          <p>
            There is a relationship between angular velocity and linear velocity. The halo is moving in a straight line, and the ray is rotating about a pivot. 
            Our job is to match the angular velocity of the ray with the linear velocity of the halo so that it's always aligned with it.
          </p>

          <p>
            To illustrate this, the best example would be watching an airplane fly towards you (which eventually passes you). When the plane is far away, your head is moving at a certain pace to track it. 
            (the angular velocity of your head moving is matching the linear velocity of the plane).
            You'll find that when it comes closer to you, your head would have to start rotating faster to track its motion (even though it is moving at the same speed). In other words, as the distance between you and the plane decrease, 
            the faster your head has to move.
          </p>

          
          <p>
            The halos have a constant linear velocity.
            We have to build an acceleration pattern for our ray to use in it's sweep, so that it
             will accurately track the halo throughout the entire trajectory.
             I have used the CSS Bezier function to do this. To put it simply, we take into account the radius (distance between spotlight emitter and halo) 
             at various points of the halo's journey, and use the differences between those radiuses to model our bezier graph.
             More info on this on the <a style="color: yellow;" href="gbc/genbezconf.html"> Generate Bezier Configuration Page</a>.

              If the triangle is not scalene, then we will go into the Two Stage module where it is splitting the trajectory into 2 and starting them in sequence.
